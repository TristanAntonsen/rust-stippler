# To Dos:

## Other ideas:
- [ ] Colored points
- [X] Colored voronoi cells
- [ ] Better circle drawing function
- [ ] Optimize polygon rasterizing ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Ztio8cwqM))
- [ ] Calculate point count based on B&W distribution
- [ ] Calculate threshold based on B&W distribution
- [ ] Iterative rejection sampling (decreasing threshold in levels)

## Geometry types
- [X] Point
- [X] Pixel
- [X] Line
- [X] Polygon (ordered)
- [X] Polygon (unordered)

## Geometry functions
- [X] Voronoi diagram
- [X] Line intersection
- [X] Polygon edges
- [X] Sort vertices
- [X] Vertex centroid (optional)

## Rasterizing
- [X] Raster Line
- [X] Scanline nodes
- [X] Raster BBox
- [X] Raster Scanline
- [X] Scanline rasterize polygon
- [X] Weighted raster centroid
- [ ] Average polygon color

## Math
- [X] Random numbers
- [X] Random seeds (uniform)
- [X] Random seeds (rejection sampling)
- [X] Nearest pixel

## Image
- [X] Read pixel
- [X] Write pixel to canvas
- [X] Export as im or pixelsage

## Bugs
- [ ] Fix weight/pixels = 0 problem

## Refactoring

- [ ] Consolidate canvas traits
- [ ]
